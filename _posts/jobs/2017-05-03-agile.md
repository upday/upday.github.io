## About the Role
We are looking for an Agile Coach to coach, enable and empower our teams. You will collaborate with 
cross functioning, highly skilled engineering teams in a fast moving environment and be a part of 
creating a product that combines the latest technology with great journalism in an unique way.

**What you will do:**

* Contribute to building an environment where continuous improvement and learning are in focus and where everyoneâ€™s common goal is to deliver outstanding software as fast as possible while keeping quality high 
* Support the teams to face tough challenges and to find improved ways of collaborating
* Ensure transparency and visibility on all dimensions
* Actively identify areas of improvement and conceptualize methods of how to work more effectively
* Work from our office in Berlin

**Who you are:**

* You have deep knowledge about and experience of different agile practices, and know what is useful to try depending on the situation
* You like to get your hands dirty. This means that you enjoy hands-on coaching of teams, as well as of other agile coaches, developers, product owners, CTO and executives
* You are not afraid to raise issues and you see impediments as opportunities to change
* You use your skills in facilitation, communication and group dynamics to help people and teams grow
* You inspire others and are good at what you are doing, but are always curious and feel that you have much left to learn
* You are a true servant leader and you find satisfaction in supporting and seeing others succeed while your own deliverables are often intangible
* You lead by example and take great pride in your work

**This would be a plus:**

* You have been developing software yourself as an engineer
* You have experience in scaling one team to many teams and handle agility in growth
