You’re comfortable tapping into different sources and making the data available for business usage, as well as querying it and optimising processes to access it. You’re able to communicate with product management and stakeholders, understand their requirements and identify the data needed to deliver a top-quality product reflecting the single truth. You take ownership for data integrity and you have the proactivity to spot, communicate and resolve issues independently.

**Qualifications and Skillset:**

* An academic degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering or equivalent practical experience
* 3+ years experience in building and maintaining a data warehouse system
* Deep familiarity with SQL as well schema variations and database design concepts

**Experience in any of the below would be a plus:**

* AWS Redshift
* Data pipelines
* Lambda-architecture
* Data mining
* Data visualisation

**Your Profile:**

* You are looking for a full-time, on-site developer position in the heart of Berlin
* You are a team player with experience working in an agile environment
* You are keen to develop your skills, and those of your team
* You have an interesting hobby such as brewing beer or space travel
