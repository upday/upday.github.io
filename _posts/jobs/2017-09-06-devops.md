## About the Role
You embrace the DevOps culture. You have clean code for breakfast, you domain drive to work, then you continuously integrate and release by lunchtime.
In the afternoon you get up-to-date with the latest technologies and before leaving, you improve the monitoring, add a circuit-breaker or do whatever is necessary to have a monkey-proof system you are proud of.
You go to bed with the DoD under your pillow and dream about orchestrating infrastructure with a smile on your face.

**Responsibilities:**

- Identify new technologies which can drive improvements in efficiency for production materials and systems
- Consult/Provide/Improve stable easy to use "PaaS" / Infrastructure / app solution

- Familiar with centralized logging and monitoring: Splunk, Datadog

**Your Profile**

- You are a team player with experience working in an agile environment
- You are keen to develop your skills, and those of your team
- You have an interesting hobby such as brewing beer or space travel
