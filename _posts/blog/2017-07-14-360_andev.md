## Denver
As part of my Silicon Valley Fellowship from Axel-Springer I had the chance to visit the 360|Andev. Please find below 
a summary of my favourite talks.

## Day 1

#### "Making your App Instant" - by <a href="https://twitter.com/jc4p">Kasra Rahjerdi </a>
Kasra Rahjerdi is the lead Android Developer at Stack Overflow and told us the story how they implemented Android Instant Apps 
for StackExchange in collaboration with Google. He highly recommended the [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-instant-apps/#0)
that Google provides. It is a tricky business to split an app that was implemented as a monolith into modules that can be reused.
He emphasized that you should **never** try to refactor your code while splitting it down. The complexity is simply to high 
and you will end up in a dead end! Split it, make it compile, if you feel so make it more beautiful - but never the other way round.
I enjoyed the talk from Kasra really much, because he is a real energetic speaker who understands to entertain his audience.

#### "Android Developer Options Deep Dive" - by <a href="https://twitter.com/asfalcone">Andrea Falcone</a>
Andrea gave a great talk about the developer options of Android. I am working now since round about 5 years with this platform,
but I did not know about all of this powerful tools.

* [Interactive Bug Report](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/bug-report.html) - interactive bug reports with 
embedded screenshots. Makes the reproduction of bugs much easier.
* wait for debugger - Did you ever had a bug in your ```onCreate()``` Method? Then this is your tool! If you turn this on the 
debugger will be attached before the app starts and you are able to debug also the beginning of the lifecycle. 
* animation scale - I guess most of us has used this tool already to turn the animations of, because they are problematic 
for our espresso tests. But the tool is much more powerful. It allows you to change the duration of all animations. 
If you set it to *Animation scale 10x* the animation will be speed up by the factor 10
The tweet below from [Kelly Schuster](https://twitter.com/KellyShuster) shows with an awesome sketchnote the complete 
content of the talk.

#### "There is room for improvement" - by [Florina Muntenescu](https://twitter.com/FMuntenescu)

Of course this was my favourite talk! It is awesome to see Florina, our former updudette and greatest advocate of upday,
now as a Google Developer Advocate. Google published at the I/O 2017 the [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
which also includes a persistence API called [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html). 
Room is not an ORM. Instead it is a wrapper that simplifies the handling of SQLite in Android. Therefore it provides convenient 
API's to define table structures, relationships and migrations. It provides compile time checks of SQLite Statements and 
can return RxJava based Flowables and Observables or [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html) 
observables. The reactive nature makes it nicely testable.

#### "RX by example - The Multicast edition Vol 3" - by [Kaushik Gopal](https://twitter.com/kaushikgopal)
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/kaushikgopal/rx-by-example-volume-3-the-multicast-edition)

If you ever had the feeling that RxJava is awesome but pretty tough to learn - well you're not alone. But no worries Kaushik comes to the rescue.
He presented in Denver the third part of his "RX by example" series. Volume 3 shows you how to *Multicast* events to several subscribers and when to use
```publish()```, ```refCount()``` and ```autoConnect()``` or in which permutations. He did an awesome job by visualizing this 
complex topic in an understandlble manner - so go and checkout his slides!

#### "Finding and Fixing Performance Problems" - [Chet Haase](https://twitter.com/chethaase) and [Romain Guy](https://twitter.com/romainguy)

Chet and Romain showed on the example of the Google Play Store how to debug performance issues in an app. In this case there is
a noticable lag while scrolling through the list of apps. They used the new profiler tool from [Android Studio 3](), that allows a deep dive into 
all the layers and threads of the view. It can be controlled like a shooter, by using w,a,s,d :-) By using the [Hierarchy viewer]() 
they figured out that the Play Store has way too many views to be rendered smoothly. Inside of the Android team they use [gfxinfo] to meassure
the performance of the app after every build and visualize it in a dashboard over time. At upday we are doing a similar thing with our ui 
tests, to discover issues in the test suite. Maybe we can use the same tech stack (elastic search and grafana) to visualize the performance of our app.

#### "Deep Android Integrations" - by <a href="https://twitter.com/tsmith">Ty Smith</a>
[video from another conf, but same talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C5bgY84WXw)

Ty implemented already for several companies (Evernote, LinkedIn and now uber) integrations into there app. He gave a neat 
tutorial how to utilize ```content providers``` and ```intents``` to communicate from one app with another one. So if you have to do 
something similar, check out his talk!

#### "Suggestions for a Totally Better Programming Language" - [Chet Haase](https://twitter.com/chethaase) and [Romain Guy](https://twitter.com/romainguy)

I am not sure what I liked the most, the emoji based language features (see pic below) or to introduce some politeness to the compiler
like ```doWork().please()``` :-) - most funniest talk I've joined so far!
