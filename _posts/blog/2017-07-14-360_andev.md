## Denver
As part of my Silicon Valley Fellowship from Axel-Springer I had the chance to visit the 360|Andev and I would like to present you some of 
the talks. 

## Day 1

#### "Making your App Instant" - by <a href="https://twitter.com/jc4p">Kasra Rahjerdi </a>
Kasra Rahjerdi is the lead Android Developer at Stack Overflow and told us the story about how they implemented Android Instant Apps 
for StackExchange in collaboration with Google. He highly recommended the [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-instant-apps/#0)
that Google provides. It is a tricky business to split an, app that was implemented as a monolith, into modules that can be reused.
He emphasized that you should *never* try to *refactor* your code while splitting it down. The complexity is simply to high 
and you will end up in a dead end! Split it, make it compile and if you feel so, make it more beautiful - but never the other way round.
I enjoyed the talk from Kasra very much, because he is a real energetic speaker who understands to entertain his audience.

#### "Android Developer Options Deep Dive" - by <a href="https://twitter.com/asfalcone">Andrea Falcone</a>
Andrea gave a great talk about the developer options of Android. I am working now since round about 5 years with this platform,
but I did not know about all the powerful tools.

* [Interactive Bug Report](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/bug-report.html) - interactive bug reports with 
embedded screenshots - makes the reproduction of bugs much easier.
* wait for debugger - Did you ever had a bug in your ```onCreate()``` method? Then this is your tool! If you turn this on, the 
debugger will be attached before the app starts and you are able to debug also the beginning of the lifecycle. 
* animation scale - I guess most of us has used this tool already to turn the animations of, because they are problematic 
for espresso tests. But the tool is much more powerful. It allows you to change the duration of all animations. 
If you set it to *Animation scale 10x* the animation will be speed up by the factor 10
This tweet from [Kelly Schuster](https://twitter.com/KellyShuster) shows with the help of an awesome sketchnote the complete 
content of the talk.

#### "There is room for improvement" - by [Florina Muntenescu](https://twitter.com/FMuntenescu)

Of course this was my favourite talk! It is awesome to see Florina, our former updudette and greatest advocate of upday,
now as a Google Developer Advocate. Google published at the I/O 2017 the [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
which also includes a persistence API called [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html). 
Room is not an ORM. Instead it is a wrapper that simplifies the handling of SQLite in Android. Therefore it provides convenient 
API's to define table structures, relationships and migrations. Next to this it gives you compile time checks of SQLite Statements and 
can return RxJava based Flowables and Observables or [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html) 
observables. The reactive nature makes it nicely testable.

#### Social Event 
The andev team invited us to the [Mellow Mushroom](http://mellowmushroom.com/store/downtown-denver) in downtown Denver, for some awesome Pizza 
and a lot of different styles of beer. It is a nice feeling if you realize that you chat with Chet Haase about how to give talks and answer questions 
in the best way. It was just amazing to see how open this community is!

## Day 2

#### "Don't fear SQL" - by [Leandro Favarin](https://twitter.com/leandrofavarin)
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/leandrofavarin/dont-fear-sql-360andev-2017)

Leandro is the Lead Android Developer of the Berlin based startup [Blinkist](http://www.blinkist.com). 
His talk was about the benefits of [SQLDelight](https://github.com/square/sqldelight) and [SQLBrite](https://github.com/square/sqlbrite)
which are both libraries provided by Square. SQLDelight generates Java models from SQL statements that you put into a ```.sq``` file. 
By utilising the power of SQL it gives you all the freedom to define every querie that you could come up with. With the words 
of Jake Wharton: *"SQL should be embraced, not hidden"*. 

It becomes tricky if you need to do migrations of your tables with SQLDelight, because it isn't officially supported yet. If you wanna follow the progress, 
there is an open issue on [Github](https://github.com/square/sqldelight/issues/89). The [IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8191-sqldelight) for SQLDelight 
including syntax highlighting, code autocompletion and shows compiler errors at build times.

[SQLBrite](https://github.com/square/sqlbrite) on the other hand allows you to introduce reactive stream functionalities to your queries. 
Definetly check out Leandro's slides if you need to deal with a database in your app.

#### "RX by example - The Multicast edition Vol 3" - by [Kaushik Gopal](https://twitter.com/kaushikgopal)
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/kaushikgopal/rx-by-example-volume-3-the-multicast-edition)

If you ever had the feeling that RxJava is awesome but pretty tough to learn - well you're not alone. But no worries Kaushik comes to the rescue.
He presented in Denver the third part of his "RX by example" series. Volume 3 shows you how to *Multicast* events to several subscribers and when to use
```publish()```, ```refCount()``` and ```autoConnect()``` or in which permutations. He did an awesome job by visualizing this 
complex topic in an understandlble manner - so go and checkout his [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/kaushikgopal/rx-by-example-volume-3-the-multicast-edition)!

#### "Finding and Fixing Performance Problems" - [Chet Haase](https://twitter.com/chethaase) and [Romain Guy](https://twitter.com/romainguy)

Chet and Romain showed on the example of the Google Play Store how to debug performance issues in an app. In this case there is
a noticable lag while scrolling through the list of apps. They used the new profiler tool from [Android Studio 3](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index.html)
, that allows a deep dive into all the layers and threads of the view elements. It can be controlled like a shooter game, by using w,a,s,d ðŸ˜ƒ 
By using the [Hierarchy viewer](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/hierarchy-viewer.html) 
they figured out that the Play Store has way too many views to be rendered smoothly. Inside of the Android team they use [gfxinfo](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/performance.html) 
to meassure the performance of the app after every build and visualize it in a dashboard over time. At upday we are doing a similar thing with our ui 
tests, to discover flaky tests in the suite. Maybe we can use the same tech stack (elastic search and grafana) to visualize the performance of our app.

#### "Deep Android Integrations" - by <a href="https://twitter.com/tsmith">Ty Smith</a>
[video from another conference, but it is the same content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C5bgY84WXw)

Ty implemented already for several companies (Evernote, Twitter and now Uber) integrations into their apps. He gave a neat 
talk how to utilize ```content providers``` and ```intents``` to communicate from one app with another. So if you have to do something similar, check out his talk!

#### "Suggestions for a Totally Better Programming Language" - [Chet Haase](https://twitter.com/chethaase) and [Romain Guy](https://twitter.com/romainguy)

I am not sure what I liked most, the emoji based language features (see pic below) or to introduce some politeness to the compiler
like ```doWork().please()``` :-) - most funniest talk I've joined so far in my life!

## Summary

To make it short: **Awesome conference!** Great opportunity to meet the Android community and big part of the Google crowd.
If you have the chance to visit the 360|Andev - go for it!
